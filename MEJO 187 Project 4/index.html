        <section class="background-info">
            <p>
                Between 2019 and 2022, cryptocurrency exchange FTX gained international prominence through aggressive marketing and low trading fees. Charismatic founder Sam Bankman-Fried promised new users high yields on deposited funds, appealing to seasoned traders and new adoptees of crypto alike. Bankman-Fried quickly became a prominent figure in the crypto space through celebrity endorsements and high early valuations.
                <br>
                <br>
                In November 2022, news outlets published the leaked balance sheet of Alameda Research, a crypto investing firm owned by Bankman-Fried. Alameda held a significant amount of FTX's digital currency (FTT), and if the value of FTT dropped, Alameda risked instant insolvency. FTT, similar to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, was created by FTX to incentivize platform usage.
                <br>
                <br>
                Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival crypto platform Binance, announced the sale of all FTT tokens held by Binance after news of Alameda's balance sheet swept the internet. This triggered a sharp decline in FTT's price, and FTX customers rushed to withdraw their assets in a virtual “bank run.” 
                <br>
                <br>
                On Nov. 8, 2022, FTX halted customer withdrawals, revealing the severity of its financial challenges. Reports indicated that FTX needed $8 billion to cover the gap between its obligations and available funds. The connection between Alameda and FTX became clearer, with allegations that Alameda had illegally used FTX funds for trading.
                <br>
                <br>
                The lack of financial transparency and clear mismanagement at FTX incensed former supporters. Sam Bankman-Fried sought help from Binance, but the proposed acquisition was quickly abandoned.
                <br>
                <br>
                On November 11, 2022, Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO, and FTX, along with its affiliated companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Bankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 and indicted for multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy.
                <br>
                <br>
                On November 2nd, 2023, Bankman-Fried was found guilty of two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.
